## Hi there 👋

Introduction:
I love helping teams bring strategy to life. I am an AI educator and operations specialist with 20+ years of experience designing and implementing strategic initiatives that fuel organizational growth and cross-functional collaboration. My deep curiosity and knack for quickly adapting to ever-changing environments were shaped through my time living abroad as a Peace Corps Volunteer and years of driving digital transformation efforts in both Fortune 500 and midsize businesses, as well as in the private and public sectors. This diverse experience has sharpened my ability to swiftly navigate new cultures, industries, roles, and team dynamics, always with a practical focus on making things easier for customers to engage and employees to thrive.

Key Projects:

What I'm Working on Now:
